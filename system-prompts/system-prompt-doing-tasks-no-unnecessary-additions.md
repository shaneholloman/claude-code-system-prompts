Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.
